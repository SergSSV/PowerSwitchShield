Power Switch Shield with S202SE2
================================

Simple shield with 2N7002 MOSFET to drive the S202SE2 Solid State Relay.  
The board is panelized to have two sub-boards with one S202SE2 and also
a sub-board with three S202SE2.

It also contains spare places to solder pull-up / pull-down resistors.
*Pull-Up: R5, R8, R12, R14, R15
*Pull-Down: R6, R7, R13, R15, R17

Resistors (R1, R3, R18, R19, R20) are calculated to get 20mA current at 3.3V supply. By using larger values (180R) it may also be used as a 5V shield.
